# AIY Project
This project add computer vision to the AIY Voice Kit by Google. More specifically, this project is about adding a PiCamera to the Voice Kit (v1) and learning to use Tensorflow plus Google Cloud Services. All of this allows your Raspberry Pi to describe what it "sees".

This detailed tutorial (available on Hackster.io) is based upon <a href="http://blog.mybigideas.uk/2018/03/adding-vision-to-your-aiy-project-in-4.html"><i>Adding Vision to the AIY Voice Kit</i></a>, by Leo White. It's been updated in Python 3 to work with the AIY Kits <a href="https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases/tag/v20181116">AIY Kits Release (Nov 2018)</a>.

Additionally, computer speech has been added - allowing machines to describe what they "see". The Voice UI demonstrates the power of using computer speech and vision together. By including things like a personalized greeting, random hello/goodbye messages, better error handling, and a few sound effects - it also provides a better quality user experience.
