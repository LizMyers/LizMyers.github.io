# AIY Project
This project adds computer vision to the AIY Voice Kit by Google. In this <a href="https://www.hackster.io/elizmyers/add-vision-to-the-aiy-voice-kit-e9ff3d">detailed tutorial</a>, (on Hackster.io) you'll learn how to add a PiCamera to the Voice Kit (v1), how to get started with Tensorflow, and how to setup Google Cloud Services. 

### What is That? Whose logo is that? What does that say?
This project is based upon <a href="http://blog.mybigideas.uk/2018/03/adding-vision-to-your-aiy-project-in-4.html"><i>Adding Vision to the AIY Voice Kit</i></a>, by Leo White. It's been updated in Python 3 to work with the <a href="https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases/tag/v20181116">AIY Kits (Release: Nov 2018)</a>.

Additionally, computer speech has been added - allowing machines to describe what they "see". <b>The Voice UI demonstrates the power of using computer speech and vision together.</b> By including things like a personalized greeting, random hello/goodbye messages, better error handling, and a few sound effects - it also provides a new and improved user experience.
