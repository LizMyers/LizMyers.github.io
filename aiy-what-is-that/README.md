# AIY Project
This project add computer vision to the AIY Voice Kit by Google. More specifically, these experiments are about adding a PiCamera to the Voice Kit (v1) and learning to use Tensorflow plus Google Cloud Services. All of this allows your Raspberry Pi to describe what it "sees".

This tutorial is based upon <a href="http://blog.mybigideas.uk/2018/03/adding-vision-to-your-aiy-project-in-4.html"><i>Adding Vision to the AIY Voice Kit</i></a>, by Leo White. It's been updated in Python 3 to work with the latest <a href="https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases/tag/v20181116">AIY Kits Release (Nov 2018)</a>.

This tutorial makes further use of the PiCamera we added in the previous tutorial. It describes images it "sees" and demonstrates an enhanced Voice UI in Python. By including things like a personalized greeting, random hello/goodbye messages, better error handling, and a few sound effects - it provides a better quality experience. */
