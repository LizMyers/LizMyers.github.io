### TFJS01
This project use the MobileNet Model for image recognition and the YouTube API for video control. In this example, the user trains the model on four gestures or poses that correspond to four video actions: play, pause, unmute, mute. While the program runs the webcam is watching for one of the poses which now trigger one of four actions.

### Coffee Guru (coming soon!)
This project uses a custome model, Tensorflow light, and React Native to provide image recognition on mobile devices. Its use case is centered around colorful coffee capsules that have been seperated from their boxes. By holding a capsule up to the webcam, the user can get relevant details about flavor, strength, and inventory level.
