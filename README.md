## TFJS - Experiments in Chrome

### TFJS01
This project use the MobileNet Model for image recognition and the YouTube API for video control. In this example, the user trains the model on four gestures or poses that correspond to four video actions: play, pause, unmute, mute. While the program runs the webcam is watching for one of the poses which now trigger these actions.

### TFJS02
V2 provides greater usability through the separation of training and inference areas.
