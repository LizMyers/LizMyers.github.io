# Tensorflow JS
## ML Experiments in Chrome

### TFJS01
This project use the MobileNet Model for image recognition and the YouTube API for video control. In this example, the user trains the model on four gestures or poses that correspond to four video actions: play, pause, unmute, mute. While the program runs the webcam is watching for one of the poses which now trigger one of four actions.

###TFJS02 (coming soon!)
This is an extension to the above project, providing more functinoality in a more compact way by making toggle switches out of play/pause, mute/unmute, fullscreen/window.

###TFJS03 (coming soon!)
This is another remix of TFJS01 - this time rotating a 360 degree video and mapping the action to the four arrows on the keyboard.

###Coffee Guru (coming soon!)
In this project I'm using a custome model, Tensorflow light, and React to provide image recognition on mobile devices. The Use Case is centered around colorful coffee capsules that have been seperated from their boxes. The idea is to hold a capsule up to the webcam to get information about the relevant flavor, strength, and inventory level (number of capsules on hand).
