# ML in Chrome with Tensorflow JS

### Getting started

Clone this repo and <b>cd into the tfjs01</b> directory. Then update the dependencies with npm install.
```
npm install
```
Use npm to run a local server on localhost: 9966.
```
npm start
```
The main.js file is where you can change things like the number of classes, related functions, and confidence score threshold. You can see your changes instantly on your local server. But when you're ready to publish, there's an extra step to take.

Be sure and run the following command to generate a new dist/build.js file. You will need to upload this along with main.js for things to work properly on the web.

```
npm run build
```
### Make it Your Own
Consider mapping the function buttons to the 4 arrow keys on your keyboard. This could be used to rotate a 360 degree video or a 3d model. 

Alternatively, you could map the arrow keys to the walking direction on a Google Map or Real Estate tour.

You could also use gestures to follow a process like cooking or mechanical repairs. Think about scenarios where your hands are dirty or occupied and you need to "turn a page" or move to the next stage of the process.
