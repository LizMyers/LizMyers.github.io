### Getting started

Clone this repo and cd into the directory. Then update the dependencies with npm install.
```
npm install
```
Use npm start to run a local server on localhost: 9966.
```
npm start
```
The main.js file is the where you can change the number of classes, confidence score threshold, and functions that map to your classes. When you're ready to publish on the web, be sure and run the following command to generate a new dist/build.js file. You will need to upload this along with main.js for things to work properly on the web

```
npm run build
```
