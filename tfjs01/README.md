# ML in Chrome with Tensorflow JS

### Getting started

Clone this repo and <b>cd into the tfjs01</b> directory. 
Use npm to run the project on a local server in your browser (Chrome recommended)
```
npm start
```
The main.js file is where you can change things like the number of classes, related functions, and minimum confidence score. You can see your changes instantly on your local server.

If you want to share your files, be sure and run the build command -- there are a lot of dependencies to inclued.

```
npm run build
```
### Make it Your Own
Consider mapping the function buttons to the 4 arrow keys on your keyboard. This could be used to rotate a 360 degree video or a 3d model. 

Alternatively, you could map the arrow keys to the walking directions on a Google Map or real estate tour.

You could also use gestures to follow a process like cooking or routine auto maintenance (think oil change or tire rotation). Think about scenarios where your hands are dirty or occupied and you need to "turn a page" or move to the next stage of the process. In those types of situations this technology could be very useful.
